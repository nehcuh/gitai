# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for evaluating whether the GitAI project has truly achieved the goals outlined in the GitAI_Diagnostic_Review.md after completing the first three phases of refactoring and optimization. The evaluation will assess the actual state of the codebase against the claimed improvements and provide an honest assessment of completion status.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to verify that duplicate code has been eliminated, so that the codebase maintains a single source of truth for each module.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN there SHALL be only one config.rs file in the workspace
2. WHEN searching for error handling patterns THEN there SHALL be zero instances of `Box<dyn Error>` in production code
3. WHEN examining module structure THEN there SHALL be no duplicate interface definitions between src/ and crates/ directories
4. IF duplicate files exist THEN the evaluation SHALL identify them as incomplete refactoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to confirm that the architecture migration to workspace structure is complete, so that the project follows modern Rust practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the src/ directory SHALL contain only workspace-level coordination code
2. WHEN analyzing crate dependencies THEN all business logic SHALL be properly separated into workspace crates
3. WHEN checking imports THEN there SHALL be no cross-references between old src/ modules and new crate modules
4. IF the migration is incomplete THEN the evaluation SHALL document remaining migration tasks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to verify that compilation warnings have been eliminated, so that the codebase meets production quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running cargo clippy THEN there SHALL be zero warnings reported
2. WHEN compiling with all features THEN there SHALL be zero compilation warnings
3. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL pass without warnings
4. IF warnings exist THEN the evaluation SHALL categorize them by severity and impact

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want to assess the actual completion percentage of the refactoring effort, so that I can make informed decisions about project status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing claimed vs actual improvements THEN the evaluation SHALL provide an honest assessment percentage
2. WHEN analyzing code quality metrics THEN the evaluation SHALL measure actual improvements against baseline
3. WHEN reviewing test coverage THEN the evaluation SHALL report actual test status vs claimed status
4. WHEN examining documentation claims THEN the evaluation SHALL verify accuracy against implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to identify remaining technical debt and issues, so that I can prioritize future work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the evaluation SHALL identify all remaining duplicate code instances
2. WHEN reviewing error handling THEN the evaluation SHALL document inconsistent patterns
3. WHEN examining architecture THEN the evaluation SHALL identify incomplete migrations
4. WHEN assessing code quality THEN the evaluation SHALL provide specific recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project reviewer, I want to understand the gap between claimed and actual achievements, so that I can provide accurate project status reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing diagnostic reports THEN the evaluation SHALL highlight discrepancies between claims and reality
2. WHEN analyzing completion metrics THEN the evaluation SHALL provide evidence-based assessments
3. WHEN reviewing implementation status THEN the evaluation SHALL identify overstated achievements
4. WHEN documenting findings THEN the evaluation SHALL provide actionable next steps
