```

**Why we do this**: Git needs to know who made each change for collaboration.

**Continue with remaining steps...**
```

### Commit Message Help

## ✍️ Writing Great Commit Messages

**The goal**: Help your future self (and teammates) understand what you changed

**Simple formula**:

```

**Examples of good messages**:
- `fix: Resolve login button not working on mobile`

### Branch Management Help
```markdown
## 🌿 Working with Branches - It's Easier Than You Think!

**Think of branches like this**: Imagine you're writing a book. The main branch is your published version, and feature branches are your drafts where you try new chapters.

**Creating a new branch** (your private workspace):
```bash
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

**Switching between branches**:
```bash
git checkout main           # Go back to main
git checkout my-new-feature # Go to your feature
```

**Why use branches?**:
- ✅ Experiment safely without breaking working code
- ✅ Work on multiple features simultaneously  
- ✅ Easy to collaborate with teammates
- ✅ Keep a clean history of changes

**Safe practice**: Always create a new branch for new work!
